This is the blog version of my website, using Jekyll of all things. It was scrapped for a more "full" overview of my code and music things.

Here's a "current" (he says, on a 3 year old branch) screenshot:

There's also a new design that I attempted, however it's stuck on an old laptop that's far away. So, `@TODO` I guess?
