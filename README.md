This repo is for my personal website at [http://peterkos.me](http://peterkos.me). 

Uses SASS ~~and possibly Coffeescript in the future~~. I like to do as much as I can in SASS before resorting to primitive methods of JavaScript. What is this, 2006? Preprocessors do half of the work for us!

Anyways, just go to the site, and if you're feeling pretty proactive, feel free to drop an issue/PR here.
