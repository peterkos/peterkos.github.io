					<li class="description">This album is my first time focusing on something other than the notes I write. Timbre was the goal from beginning to end, as by this point I could write consonant harmony with some sense of confidence. The album's title, "Conquest", stands for the conquest of my fears of overcoming where I was a year prior. The album art is of a game <i>Tribes: Ascend</i>, which I used to escape to and think about who I was.</li>
					<li>"Amend" carries this theme of overcoming with a soothing ambient background. Glitch percussion cuts through this atmospheric barrier, however. Even though you want to feel calm, there's always something cutting out -- some sort of rhythmic force that drives you forward, or makes you feel like you're being chased as you try to move on. As the tonality changes halfway through the song, the orchestra starts its foray, testing out melodies with the glitched percussion always playing in the background. At 2:34, the orchestra swells over you suddenly, and before you know it, the amendment is over, and reversed, echoed piano sounds drag you into the next song.</li>
					<li> "Confabulation" is one of my first forays into a piano composition, and as a result, I was looking at it from an orchestral perspective, rather than from a pianist's. This caused the duet style to be a bit unbalanced, but resulted in a unique and very dynamic piece. The highest and lowest registers of the piano were used at volume from pianissimo to fortissimo. Mirroring the title (which is just a fancy word for discussion), the song features a lot of counterpoint and canon, particularly around the halfway mark. There, the piece develops a Bach-esque structure, and the two players echo each other's developments. The piece soon ends, but doesn't resolve. </li>
					<li>"The Enemy" is a the penultimate song in this album, </li>
					<li>Fourth song is about...</li>
