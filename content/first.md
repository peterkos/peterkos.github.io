## Background

I figured it's time I finally made a blog.

With all of the [projects](https://github.com/peterkos) I have going on (especially codeRIT stuff), there's hours of cool ideas and projects that never really see the light of day: Discord bots, shell scripts.

There's also many hours of debugging that I want to document. Both for my future self, and any other people who struggle with the same things.

## Behind the Background

I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a hacked-up version of [cactus](https://github.com/monkeyWzr/hugo-theme-cactus) (which is in turn, a port from the [jekyll cactus](https://github.com/probberechts/hexo-theme-cactus)).

I've been through MANY site designs and settled for this. I find the blog frameworks really bloated, and the themes a bit difficult to work with, but something is better than nothing. (And this is coming from an ex-[Wordpress](github.com/peterkos/bcnpsa) developer!)

## How Often?

If I'm programming at least a few times a week, I'll guaranteed have a post up once every two weeks. It's just how things go.

However, if I ever decide to break out as a YouTube vlogging star or something, that might take priority. Expect an post on that at some point.
