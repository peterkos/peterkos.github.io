I compose music, hammer out lots of code, and spend too much time watching cat videos. Listen to some of my latest compositions as a [reel](https://www.notion.so/peterkos/Music-Reel-Peter-Kos-6352f381c3cc4d7cb4a0e99a79b8dd79), or my [full portfolio](https://peterkos.notion.site/). I'm currently developing [Cabinette](https://cabinette.app), a macOS app to manage discographies. Check it out!

Currently iOS II @ [willowtree](https://willowtreeapps.com)
