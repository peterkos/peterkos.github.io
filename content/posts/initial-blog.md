## Background

I figured it's time I finally made a blog.

With all of the [projects](https://github.com/peterkos) I have going on (especially codeRIT stuff), there's hours of cool ideas and projects that never really see the light of day: Discord bots, shell scripts.

There's also many hours of debugging that I want to document. Both for my future self, and any other people who struggle with the same things.

## Behind the Background

I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a hacked-up version of [cactus](https://github.com/monkeyWzr/hugo-theme-cactus) (which is in turn, a port from the [jekyll cactus](https://github.com/probberechts/hexo-theme-cactus))
