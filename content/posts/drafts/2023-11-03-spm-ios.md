</div>

Every time I opened Xcode, _every time_, it would attempt to "Resolve packages...". Even if no dependencies changed. There wasn't an outward fix, with various [poking-and-prodding](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/678974), "raise your right hand and click compile" solutions yielding no results. Alas, we were doomed to wait 1-2 minutes each time Xcode started.

Oh we'll get there.

> "But Peter, why were you restarting Xcode so much?"

We were using xcodegen, which requires [re-running](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen/blob/master/Docs/FAQ.md#what-happens-when-i-switch-branches) if files were added/removed, which is likely when switching branches. This generates a new `.xcodeproj` file, which Xcode is actively using... so, a restart is necessary. Tack on some code reviews, testing feedback, your own feature branch, and the-one-branch-someone-needed-help-with, and you'll end up with the following:

```fish
# ~/.config/fish/config.fish
alias kx "killall Xcode"
```

**Problem: Xcode is too slow.**
What are our options?
- Switch to Android
- Use another editor
- Be patient

Patience is a virtue held until one realizes their processor runs _four billion cycles a second_, which is $4.8Ã—10^{11}$ cycles as you stare at Xcode. Android is green, and I'm colorblind, so let's try out a new editor for the time being.

# The Language Server Protocol to My Heart

Luckily, the folks at Redmond built [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/). Any editor can hook into some language's backend for autocomplete+formatting, and all it needs to worry about is how to show that information to the user. [Sourcekit-LSP](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/) works with Swift too.

I've been playing around with [helix](https://helix-editor.com), so let's fire up a new iOS project in Xcode for Swift/SwiftUI, open it in Helix, aaaand...

```sh
[ERROR] sourcekit-lsp err <-
        "could not find manifest, or not a SwiftPM package: [...]SwiftyFlashlight\n"
[ERROR] sourcekit-lsp err <-
        "could not open compilation database for
        [...]SwiftyFlashlight/SwiftyFlashlight/ContentView.swift\n"
[ERROR] editor error: no such command: 'log-o'
```

Oops. Since sourcekit-lsp [doesn't yet support Xcode projects](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/issues/730), we need to create this app as a **SPM** package, not an Xcode project.

```sh
> mkdir SwiftyFlashlightCore
> cd SwiftyFlashlightCore
> swift package init --name "SwiftyFlashlightCore"
> ls
Package.swift Sources Tests
> hx .
```

Woo! We get autocomplete.

# We Need To Go Deeper (SPM)

those PRs are almost right...


# Found it!

_AHHH!!!_

Let's look at a standalone project to demonstrate the issue.

1. Create a project with `swift package init --name testproj`
1. Add a dependency (i.e., Factory) to `Package.swift` that has both iOS _and_ macOS targets:


```swift,hl_lines=5 12-14 18
// swift-tools-version: 5.9
import PackageDescription
let package = Package(
    name: "testproj",
    platforms: [.iOS(.v16)],
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "testproj",
            targets: ["testproj"]
        ),
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/hmlongco/Factory", from: "2.3.1")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "testproj",
            dependencies: ["Factory"]
        ),
        .testTarget(
            name: "testprojTests",
            dependencies: ["testproj"]
        ),
    ]
)
```

If one were to FOOLISHLY run this PREPOSTEROUS configuration on macOS 10.13, the following is observed:

```sh
> swift build --triple arm64-apple-ios-simulator \
              --sdk "$(xcrun --sdk iphonesimulator --show-sdk-path)"

error: the library 'testproj' requires macos 10.13,
       but depends on the product 'Factory' which requires macos 10.14;
       consider changing the library 'testproj' to require macos 10.14 or later,
       or the product 'Factory' to require macos 10.13 or earlier.
```

It's checking `macOS` versions, even though we only specified `.iOS(.v16)` as a platform. Turns out, there's this cute snippet in the [SPM docs](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/main/Documentation/PackageDescription.md#supportedplatform):


<div class="note">
    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>By default, the Swift Package Manager assigns a predefined minimum deployment version for each supported platforms [sic] unless you configure supported platforms [sic] using the platforms API.</p>
</div>

That means our Package.swift actually looks like _this_:

```swift, hl_lines=3
platforms: [
    .iOS(.v16),
    .macOS(.v13)
],

// Factory's Package.swift
// src: https://github.com/hmlongco/Factory/blob/main/Package.swift
platforms: [
    .iOS(.v11),
    .macOS(.v10_14),
    .tvOS(.v13),
    .watchOS(.v8)
],
```

Our dependency has a higher minimum for `macOS` than our project does. Sure, it's quirky that SPM infers defaults like that, but think back to our original command. We didn't _specify_ macOS. We specified _iOS_!

```sh
> swift build --triple arm64-apple-ios-simulator \
              --sdk "$(xcrun --sdk iphonesimulator --show-sdk-path)"
```

<div class="note">
    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> SPM isn't respecting the platform inferred from `--triple` by the time we validate our dependencies.</p>
</div>

Putting our thinking hats on, what could go wrong?
- Flattening iOS/macOS down to darwin while parsing args, and if `platform == darwin`, treating that as macOS
- Assuming the


at different points:
- Passing args to the compiler's build flags
