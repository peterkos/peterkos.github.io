# Background

This all started because Xcode was too slow.

Every time I opened Xcode, _every time_, it would attempt to resolve packages. Even if no dependencies changed. There was no obvious fix, with various [poke-and-prod](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/678974), "raise your right hand and click compile" solutions yielding no results. Alas, we were doomed to wait 1-2 minutes each time Xcode started.

Oh we'll get there.

> "But Peter, why were you restarting Xcode so much?"

We had a large number of devs, so it made sense to use `xcodegen` to generate our .xcodeproj file and cut down on the number of XML merge conflicts. However, if files were added/removed, we had to [re-run the generation]((https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen/blob/master/Docs/FAQ.md#what-happens-when-i-switch-branches)). Since the `.xcodeproj` file is actively read by Xcode while it's open, Xcode needed to be given a polite restart. No issue... except for the very high likelihood that files are added/removed on new branches. Tack on some code reviews, testing feedback, `branch-chris-final`, your own feature branch, and the-one-branch-someone-needed-help-with, and you'll end up with the following:

```fish
# ~/.config/fish/config.fish
alias kx "killall Xcode"
```

**Problem: Xcode is too slow.**

What are our options?
- Be patient
- Switch to Android
- Use another editor

Patience is a virtue held until one realizes their processor runs _four billion cycles a second_, which is $4.8Ã—10^{11}$ cycles as you stare at Xcode. Android is green, and I'm colorblind. New editor it is.

# The Language Server Protocol to My Heart

Luckily, the folks at Redmond put down their photocopiers and built [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/). Any editor can hook into some language's backend for autocomplete+formatting, and all it needs to worry about is how to show that information to the user. [Sourcekit-LSP](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/) enables it to work with Swift! This is a good start.

I've been playing around with [helix](https://helix-editor.com), so let's fire up a new iOS project in Xcode for Swift/SwiftUI, open it in Helix, aaaand...

```sh
[ERROR] sourcekit-lsp err
        "could not find manifest, or not a SwiftPM package: [...]SwiftFlashlight\n"
[ERROR] sourcekit-lsp err
        "could not open compilation database for
        [...]SwiftDemo/SwiftFlashlight/ContentView.swift\n"
[ERROR] editor error: no such command: 'log-o'
```

Oops. Since sourcekit-lsp [doesn't yet support Xcode projects](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/issues/730), we need to create this app as an **SPM** package.

```sh
> mkdir SwiftFlashlightCore
> cd SwiftFlashlightCore
> swift package init --name "SwiftFlashlightCore"
> ls
Package.swift Sources Tests
> hx .
```

Some scaffolding:
```swift
// Package.swift
let package = Package(
    name: "SwiftFlashlightCore",
    platforms: [.iOS(.v16)],
    // ...
)

// Sources/SwiftFlashlightCore/SwiftFlashlightCore.swift
public func sayHello() {
    print("Hello, World!")
}
```

Woo! We have autocomplete!

We still need Xcode to do code signing, distribution, and not alienate the entire dev team. To solve this, we can make a wrapper Xcode project that imports this SPM package locally. The best part? This enables code modularization using SPM! Network module, UI module, that sort of thing.

To add a local SPM dependency:
1. Xcode -> New Project... -> iOS App
1. File -> "Add Package Dependencies"
1. "Add Local...", and navigate to SwiftFlashlightCore from the last step
1. Make sure "SwiftFlashlight" target is selected under "Add To Target"

Now, we can call our test function:

```swift
// SwiftFlashlight/ContentView.swift
import SwiftUI
import SwiftFlashlightCore

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
            .onAppear {
                SwiftFlashlightCore.sayHello()
            }
    }
}
```

# We Need To Go Deeper

The demo project works... but things fell apart when I tried loading the full iOS codebase. SPM failed to initialize, and the LSP logs were not very helpful. I switched to the more familiar Sublime Text, and started digging.

```
// LSP logs:
error: the library 'ProblemAppp' requires macos 10.13,
but depends on the product 'hmlongco/Factory' which requires macos 10.14;  [...]
```

Questions emerged:
1. Where does Sourcekit-LSP infer target architecture?
1. Dependency checking? Was it running `swift build`?
1. Why was our Package platform setting ignored?

Let's go through each of these.

## Where does Sourcekit-LSP infer target architecture?

My first instinct was to clone Sourcekit and set breakpoints. Surely the problem would reveal itself somewhere down the chain. I did so using Sublime Text. A stubborn mistake.

Step one was to set Sublime's LSP to point to our local clone -- not the one on the system toolchain.

```json
// LSP-SourceKit.sublime-settings
{
  "enabled": true,
  "command": [
    "~/Code/GitHub/sourcekit-lsp/.build/arm64-apple-macosx/debug/sourcekit-lsp"
  ],
}
```

To set breakpoints via LLDB, I found [SublimeDebugger](https://github.com/daveleroy/SublimeDebugger) and set a configuration, but it failed to catch on anything.

```json
// sourcekit-lsp.sublime-project
"debugger_configurations":[{
    "type": "lldb",
    "request": "attach",
    "name": "Attach",
    "program": "${folder}/.build/arm64-apple-macosx/debug/sourcekit-lsp",
    "waitFor": true,
    "lldb.library": "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/LLDB.framework/Versions/A/LLDB",
    "lldb.verboseLogging": true
}]
```

After about a week (I wish I was kidding), the first culprit was found. This plugin was a wrapper of codelldb, whose [Swift setup docs](https://github.com/vadimcn/codelldb/wiki/Swift) mention to set `lldb.library` manually. But! SublimeDebugger has this [horrific](https://github.com/daveleroy/SublimeDebugger/blob/95b7098d6d432e38b847bd1d42c525186e4e64f8/Debugger.sublime-settings#L57-L58) line in its config, overriding any lldb.library setting to `null` implicitly. Solution: remove the lldb.library from the project config, and add it as a plugin config item instead, [file an issue](https://github.com/daveleroy/SublimeDebugger/issues/229), and mark another week of my life spent debugging configuration files.

```json
// Debugger.sublime-settings
{
    "lldb_library": "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/LLDB.framework/Versions/A/LLDB",
}
```

Okay. I can set breakpoints. I can poke through Sourcekit-LSP's codebase. I can trace the execution path. I can find where it infers the build target... and oh. It doesn't.

Sourcekit-LSP is wholly dependent on Swift Package Manager. A build needs to run first to generate a symbol dictionary, from which Sourcekit-LSP can do lookups and completions. Those _seemed_ to get passed to SPM -- but was it? And did it get to the compiler? And what about `xcodebuild`, `xcrun`? How are the flags resolved? Which tools call which other tools? Do they all point to same thing?

## Dependency checking? Was it running `swift build`?

These are the major characters of our circus:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
|`xcodebuild` | Runs the Xcode build system via the command line |
|`xcrun` | Runs a command using the current Xcode environment (toolchains, etc.) |
|`swift build` | Runs the SPM build tool that _invokes_ compiler(s) to build source files |
|`swiftc` | The Swift compiler |

I was trying this command:

```sh
> swift build
  --sdk    /path/to/ios/sdk \
  -Xswiftc -target \
  -Xswiftc arm64-apple-ios16 \
  -Xcc     --target=arm64-apple-ios16 \
  -Xcxx    --target=arm64-apple-ios16 \
```
It tells Swift compiler and all C/C++ compilers down the chain to set our target to iOS 16. To find our SDK path, we need to use the Xcode CLI commands above.

```sh
> xcodebuild -showsdks
iOS SDKs:
	iOS 16.0                      	-sdk iphoneos16.0
iOS Simulator SDKs:
	Simulator - iOS 16.0          	-sdk iphonesimulator16.0
```

(I decided to stick with the _simulator_ SDK, even though I can't think of a reason the simulator would need nor have a different SDK than a physical device.)

```sh
> xcrun --sdk iphonesimulator16.0 --show-sdk-path
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator16.0.sdk
```

Nice! And along the way, I found [this neat PR](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/pull/6732) that lets use `--triple` for iOS targets. Let's use that instead, and add our SDK path to `swift build`:

```sh
> swift build \
  --sdk   /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator16.0.sdk \
  --triple iphonesimulator16.0
```

Still nothing. Lovely.

## Why was our Package platform setting ignored?

I was frustrated. We set our platform in `Package.swift` to be iOS. We told SPM to compile for iOS. Why was it falling back to macOS?

The high-level execution chain is as follows:
```
Sourcekit-LSP -> SPM -> Swift compiler
```

Since Sourcekit did no actual building, I needed to debug SPM directly. Later, we'll need to point Sourcekit to use our local copy of SPM, but for now, we're only debugging the SPM <-> Swift compiler link.

There was a clue in the [PR I mentioned before](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/pull/6828):

> We can't assume that darwin == macOS anymore [...]









# Oh.

Let's look at a standalone project to demonstrate the issue.

1. Create a project with `swift package init --name testproj`
1. Add a dependency (i.e., Factory) to Package.swift that has both iOS _and_ macOS targets:


```swift,hl_lines=5 12-14 18
// swift-tools-version: 5.9
import PackageDescription
let package = Package(
    name: "testproj",
    platforms: [.iOS(.v16)],
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "testproj",
            targets: ["testproj"]
        ),
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/hmlongco/Factory", from: "2.3.1")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "testproj",
            dependencies: ["Factory"]
        ),
        .testTarget(
            name: "testprojTests",
            dependencies: ["testproj"]
        ),
    ]
)
```

If one were to foolishly run this preposterous configuration on macOS 10.13, the following is observed:

```sh
> swift build --triple arm64-apple-ios-simulator \
              --sdk "$(xcrun --sdk iphonesimulator --show-sdk-path)"

error: the library 'testproj' requires macos 10.13,
       but depends on the product 'Factory' which requires macos 10.14;
       consider changing the library 'testproj' to require macos 10.14 or later,
       or the product 'Factory' to require macos 10.13 or earlier.
```

It's checking `macOS` versions, even though we only specified `.iOS(.v16)` as a platform. Turns out, there's this cute snippet in the [SPM docs](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/main/Documentation/PackageDescription.md#supportedplatform):


<div class="note">
    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>By default, the Swift Package Manager assigns a predefined minimum deployment version for each supported platforms unless you configure supported platforms [sic] using the platforms API.</p>
</div>

That means our Package.swift actually looks like _this_:

```swift, hl_lines=3
platforms: [
    .iOS(.v16),
    .macOS(.v13) // Implicit
],

// Factory's Package.swift
// src: https://github.com/hmlongco/Factory/blob/main/Package.swift
platforms: [
    .iOS(.v11),
    .macOS(.v10_14),
    .tvOS(.v13),
    .watchOS(.v8)
],
```

Our dependency has a higher minimum for `macOS` than our project does. Sure, it's quirky that SPM infers defaults like that, but think back to our original command. We didn't _specify_ macOS. We specified _iOS_!

```sh
> swift build --triple arm64-apple-ios-simulator \
              --sdk "$(xcrun --sdk iphonesimulator --show-sdk-path)"
```

<div class="note">
    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> SPM isn't respecting the platform inferred from `--triple` by the time we validate our dependencies.</p>
</div>

Putting our thinking hats on, what could go wrong?
- Flattening iOS/macOS down to darwin while parsing args, and if `platform == darwin`, treating that as macOS
- Assuming the






```sh
export TOOLCHAIN="/Library/Developer/Toolchains/swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2023-10-04-a.xctoolchain"
```
