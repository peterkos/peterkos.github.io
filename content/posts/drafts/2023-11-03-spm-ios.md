# Swift Package Manager + iOS


## Background


## Debugging: LSP


## We Need To Go Deeper (SPM)

those PRs are almost right...


## Found it!

Let's look at a standalone project to demonstrate the issue.

1. Create a project with `swift package new myproj`
1. Add a dependency (i.e., Factory) to `Package.swift` that has both iOS _and_ macOS targets:


```swift,hl_lines=4 10-12 16
// swift-tools-version: 5.9
import PackageDescription
let package = Package(
    name: "testproj",
    platforms: [.iOS(.v16)],
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "testproj",
            targets: ["testproj"]),
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/hmlongco/Factory", from: "2.3.1")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "testproj",
            dependencies: ["Factory"]),
        .testTarget(
            name: "testprojTests",
            dependencies: ["testproj"]
            ),
    ]
)



```
