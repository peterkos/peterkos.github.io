# Background

This all started because Xcode was too slow.

Every time I opened Xcode, _every time_, it would attempt to resolve packages. Even if no dependencies changed. There was no obvious fix, with various [poke-and-prod](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/678974), "raise your right hand and click compile" solutions yielding no results. Alas, we were doomed to wait 1-2 minutes each time Xcode started.

Oh we'll get there.

> "But Peter, why were you restarting Xcode so much?"

We had a large number of devs, so it made sense to use `xcodegen` to generate our .xcodeproj file and cut down on the number of XML merge conflicts. However, if files were added/removed, we had to [re-run the generation]((https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen/blob/master/Docs/FAQ.md#what-happens-when-i-switch-branches)). Since the `.xcodeproj` file is actively read by Xcode while it's open, Xcode needed to be given a polite restart. No issue... except for the very high likelihood that files are added/removed on new branches. Tack on some code reviews, testing feedback, `branch-chris-final`, your own feature branch, and the-one-branch-someone-needed-help-with, and you'll end up with the following:

```fish
# ~/.config/fish/config.fish
alias kx "killall Xcode"
```

**Problem: Xcode is too slow.**

What are our options?
- Be patient
- Switch to Android
- Use another editor

Patience is a virtue held until one realizes their processor runs _four billion cycles a second_, which is $4.8Ã—10^{11}$ cycles as you stare at Xcode. Android is green, and I'm colorblind. New editor it is.

# The Language Server Protocol to My Heart

Luckily, the folks at Redmond put down their photocopiers and built [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/). Any editor can hook into some language's backend for autocomplete+formatting, and all it needs to worry about is how to show that information to the user. [Sourcekit-LSP](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/) enables it to work with Swift! This is a good start.

I've been playing around with [helix](https://helix-editor.com), so let's fire up a new iOS project in Xcode for Swift/SwiftUI, open it in Helix, aaaand...

```sh
[ERROR] sourcekit-lsp err
        "could not find manifest, or not a SwiftPM package: [...]SwiftFlashlight\n"
[ERROR] sourcekit-lsp err
        "could not open compilation database for
        [...]SwiftDemo/SwiftFlashlight/ContentView.swift\n"
[ERROR] editor error: no such command: 'log-o'
```

Oops. Since sourcekit-lsp [doesn't yet support Xcode projects](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/issues/730), we need to create this app as an **SPM** package.

```sh
> mkdir SwiftFlashlightCore
> cd SwiftFlashlightCore
> swift package init --name "SwiftFlashlightCore"
> ls
Package.swift Sources Tests
> hx .
```

Woo! We have autocomplete!

<img src="/post-assets/spm-ios/helix-spm-v1.png" class="half-center" alt="screenshot of helix editor with autocomplete in package.swift file on the .library function"/>

```swift
// Sources/SwiftFlashlightCore/SwiftFlashlightCore.swift
public func sayHello() {
    print("Hello, World!")
}
```

We still need Xcode to do code signing, distribution, and not alienate the entire dev team. To solve this, we can make a wrapper Xcode project that imports this SPM package locally. The best part? This enables code modularization using SPM! Network module, UI module, that sort of thing.


1. Xcode -> New Project... -> iOS App
1. File -> "Add Package Dependencies"
1. "Add Local...", and navigate to SwiftFlashlightCore from the last step
1. Make sure "SwiftFlashlight" target is selected under "Add To Target"

Now, we can call our test function:

```swift
// SwiftFlashlight/ContentView.swift
import SwiftUI
import SwiftFlashlightCore

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
            .onAppear {
                SwiftFlashlightCore.sayHello()
            }
    }
}
```

# We Need To Go Deeper (SPM)

The demo project works... but things fell apart when I tried loading the full iOS codebase. SPM failed to initialize, and the LSP logs were not very helpful. I switched to the more familiar Sublime Text, and started digging.

```
// LSP logs:
error: the library 'ProblemAppp' requires macos 10.13,
but depends on the product 'hmlongco/Factory' which requires macos 10.14;  [...]
```

Questions emerged:
1. Where did Sourcekit-LSP (incorrectly) infer this was a macOS project?
1. Why was it checking dependencies? Was it running `swift build`?
1. How do I tell the Swift build system to compile for iOS?

Let's go through each of these.

*_1. Where did Sourcekit-LSP (incorrectly) infer this was a macOS project?_*

My first instinct was to clone Sourcekit and set breakpoints. Surely the problem would reveal itself somewhere down the chain. I did so using Sublime Text; a stubborn mistake. I found [SublimeDebugger](https://github.com/daveleroy/SublimeDebugger), and set a configuration, but it failed to catch on anything.
```json
// sourcekit-lsp.sublime-project
"debugger_configurations":[{
    "type": "lldb",
    "request": "attach",
    "name": "Attach",
    "program": "${folder}/.build/arm64-apple-macosx/debug/sourcekit-lsp",
    "waitFor": true,
    "lldb.library": "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/LLDB.framework/Versions/A/LLDB",
    "lldb.verboseLogging": true
}]
```

After about a week (I wish I was kidding), the first culprit was found. This plugin was a wrapper of codelldb, whose [Swift setup docs](https://github.com/vadimcn/codelldb/wiki/Swift) mention to set `lldb.library` manually. But! SublimeDebugger has this [horrific](https://github.com/daveleroy/SublimeDebugger/blob/95b7098d6d432e38b847bd1d42c525186e4e64f8/Debugger.sublime-settings#L57-L58) line in its config, overriding any lldb.library setting to `null` implicitly. Solution: remove the lldb.library from the project config, and add it as a plugin config item instead, [file an issue](https://github.com/daveleroy/SublimeDebugger/issues/229), and mark another week of my life spent debugging configuration files.

```json
// Debugger.sublime-settings
{
    "lldb_library": "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/LLDB.framework/Versions/A/LLDB",
}
```

I can set breakpoints. I can poke through Sourcekit-LSP's codebase. I can sniff out the bugs. I can find where it infers the build target.

It turns out that Sourcekit is wholly dependent on Swift Package Manager. A build needs to run first to generate a symbol dictionary, from which it can do lookups and completions.





```
swift build --sdk /path/to/ios/sdk -Xswiftc -target -Xswiftc arm64-apple-ios15.4 -Xcc --target=arm64-apple-ios15.4 -Xcxx --target=arm64-apple-ios15.4

```



```sh
export TOOLCHAIN="/Library/Developer/Toolchains/swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2023-10-04-a.xctoolchain"
```

# Oh.

Let's look at a standalone project to demonstrate the issue.

1. Create a project with `swift package init --name testproj`
1. Add a dependency (i.e., Factory) to Package.swift that has both iOS _and_ macOS targets:


```swift,hl_lines=5 12-14 18
// swift-tools-version: 5.9
import PackageDescription
let package = Package(
    name: "testproj",
    platforms: [.iOS(.v16)],
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "testproj",
            targets: ["testproj"]
        ),
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/hmlongco/Factory", from: "2.3.1")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "testproj",
            dependencies: ["Factory"]
        ),
        .testTarget(
            name: "testprojTests",
            dependencies: ["testproj"]
        ),
    ]
)
```

If one were to FOOLISHLY run this PREPOSTEROUS configuration on macOS 10.13, the following is observed:

```sh
> swift build --triple arm64-apple-ios-simulator \
              --sdk "$(xcrun --sdk iphonesimulator --show-sdk-path)"

error: the library 'testproj' requires macos 10.13,
       but depends on the product 'Factory' which requires macos 10.14;
       consider changing the library 'testproj' to require macos 10.14 or later,
       or the product 'Factory' to require macos 10.13 or earlier.
```

It's checking `macOS` versions, even though we only specified `.iOS(.v16)` as a platform. Turns out, there's this cute snippet in the [SPM docs](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/main/Documentation/PackageDescription.md#supportedplatform):


<div class="note">
    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>By default, the Swift Package Manager assigns a predefined minimum deployment version for each supported platforms unless you configure supported platforms [sic] using the platforms API.</p>
</div>

That means our Package.swift actually looks like _this_:

```swift, hl_lines=3
platforms: [
    .iOS(.v16),
    .macOS(.v13) // Implicit
],

// Factory's Package.swift
// src: https://github.com/hmlongco/Factory/blob/main/Package.swift
platforms: [
    .iOS(.v11),
    .macOS(.v10_14),
    .tvOS(.v13),
    .watchOS(.v8)
],
```

Our dependency has a higher minimum for `macOS` than our project does. Sure, it's quirky that SPM infers defaults like that, but think back to our original command. We didn't _specify_ macOS. We specified _iOS_!

```sh
> swift build --triple arm64-apple-ios-simulator \
              --sdk "$(xcrun --sdk iphonesimulator --show-sdk-path)"
```

<div class="note">
    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> SPM isn't respecting the platform inferred from `--triple` by the time we validate our dependencies.</p>
</div>

Putting our thinking hats on, what could go wrong?
- Flattening iOS/macOS down to darwin while parsing args, and if `platform == darwin`, treating that as macOS
- Assuming the


at different points:
- Passing args to the compiler's build flags
