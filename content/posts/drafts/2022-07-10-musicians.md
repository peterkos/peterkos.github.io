Let's take the situation of wanting to be a composer, out of 100 million people who exist at any point in time `t`.

Some will never even think to make music.

Some will self-prescribe as "non-musicians", and not try.

Some will try in other ways (playing an instrument) but self-prescribe as "not good enough" (fixed mindset).

Some will start watching YouTube videos of producers/composers, enamored by the process but still not try do do much with it.

Some will download a trial of Ableton, and immediately delete it at the learning curve of its interface.

Some will dowload a trial of Ableton, and make _something_.



> Here, we've already reached a percent of a percent. This is were most advice to people who struggle in college tends to sit at: "oh, but a lot of people don't even get into college!" -- that kind of thing.

> It's unhelpful for a lot of reasons, but most obviously because its not applicable to _me_, the composer. Sure, great, Ryan from Calculus II didn't proceed to write any music, but Ryan was never going to write any in the first place, for a reason that nobody will know because we don't have a first `WIP` to point to.



Some will make a couple of "songs", but ultimately give up realizing how much work it takes.

Some will run out of trial time, and not know how to torrent.

(Some trials didn't run out, but are all somehow licensed to "Stepan Zaytsev".)

Some will try to download plugins, and not try to understand what VST and AU are.

Some will download ten plugins, get bored of all of them, and give up.

Some will not hear much of a difference in their music, now six months after their trial, as they aren't getting the right feedback, or experimenting enough, so they stop.



> At this point, we are at yet another percent of a percent. The technical challenge of music-making is real and ripe for blame when people want a reason to do something else instead.

> Everyone who is left at this point is curious, technically capable, and determined, if not patient. Nobody here has skill yet, that'll take one or two years to make something that sounds decent.

> So we conitnue on.


Some will enter college and be too busy to keep playing around with Ableton.

Some will notice no improvement after a year, and give up.

Some will not get a constructive source of feedback, and plateau.

Some will make a decision to not pursue music as a career, and it will never take up more than 5 hours of their day for the rest of their working life.

Some will continuously struggle to find the right connection, as they live in the wrong city.

Some will find the right connection at the right time, but have personal difficulties that leave a sour taste in their mouth.

> Those who are here are considered genuinely good, and may even have a few thousand listeners, and a couple of notable works. (At the very least, friends who don't make fun of their Soundcloud.)

Some struggle to find their passion as side jobs erode their energy.

Some run out of money, as they were not able to find a consistent stream of income; making the wrong bet on music.

Some move to LA and are relegated to being a composer's assistant, and never make their break.

> These are now considered "Almost-Elite" composers, with an impressive portfolio, and are well-known amongst directors and musicians alike.

> The only thing stopping them here is public recognition.

Some never get public recognition.

> The rest -- probably five or six names -- you already know.
