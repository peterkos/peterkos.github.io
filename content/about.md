Dubbed by some as "Hank Green's cousin" and by others as a "wonk"[^1], I was previously an iOS engineer at [willowtree](https://willowtreeapps.com), having built apps for [Empathable](https://empathable.com/), Fox Sports, Telus, and ███████, a Fortune-50 carrier.

I led the hackathon group at [BrickHack](https://brickhack.io/club) for a while:
- Built the BrickHack 6 iOS App (_[GitHub](https://github.com/codeRIT/brickhack-mobile-ios/)_)
- Maintained [HackEngine](https://github.com/coderit/hackathon-manager), our Rails event-management tool
- Led development on the BrickHack 7 website, and `authbot`, a Discord bot for auth
- Ran the team of ~6 hard-working, hilarious people through covid, hell, and back

And, I had a few stints as intern:
- [Whoop](https://whoop.com) (iOS widget, Smart Alarm, + other sleep features)
- [Tomorrow Ideas](https://tomorrow.me) (localizing the backend API in PHP ✨).
- AIHealth, a research project to track spinal health


This was preceeded by three years <span style="color: orange">RIT (CS)</span>, after two years at <span style="color: var(--primary-color);">UW (CS+music)</span>.

Other _other_ interests include improvising piano, performing piano (currently _Pathetique sonata_, _French Suite No. 2_, _Impromptu No. 2 in Eb Major_), singing (choir, baritone), and making elektronik beatz. I'm a person too, though! Promise. I like cats and memes and stuff. Pepperoni and sausage pizza. Vanilla sweet cream cold brew. The Mistborn trilogy. John Green! Discord!
