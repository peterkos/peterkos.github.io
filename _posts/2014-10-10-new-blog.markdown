I've started a blog!

This will (mainly) accompany my [YouTube](http://youtube.com/pkos91) channel with text forms of most videos, and stuff that generally isn't fit for a full ~5-20 mintue tutorial. Expect a few code snippets (as seen below) as well.

Additionally, below every post will be links to instructions for installing any dependencies. For example, if I do a post on a jekyll plugin, I'll [put a link]() to my Jekyll installation guide.

Thanks for coming by!
